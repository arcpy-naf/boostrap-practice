Not only charming but also amazingly persuasive, he could regularly sweet-talk publishers or newspapers into underwriting his extravagances. In particular, Connolly loved good food, expensive wine, first-class travel, inscribed first editions, the South of France and, not least, comely young women. These last, it should be quickly added, nearly always loved him back and usually continued to love him even after the relationship was over.Some time ago, I wrote a long essay on my favorite modern literary journalist, the feckless, self-centered, self-pitying, vacillating, indolent and brilliant Cyril Connolly, editor of the 1940s British literary magazine Horizon and the 20th century’s finest writer of classic English prose, with the possible exception of his friend Evelyn Waugh.
